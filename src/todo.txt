TODO: to handle double quotes, just enable a state where if you're inside a double quote, 
    you don't generate a token after a whitespace
    Following that, you actually keep the tokens as words, but they would contain spaces, doublequotes
    Only after that, you'd pass over the WORD tokens and then reconstruct them appropriately, depending on doublequotes,
    singlequotes, and env variable expansions

So the plan is: Lexer -> Expansion -> File handling -> Execution
